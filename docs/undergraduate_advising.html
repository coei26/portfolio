                  The current undergraduate advising website for the University
                  of Washington only provides booking information for general
                  advisers. Students exploring different majors or students with
                  major-related questions must navigate to the individual
                  webpages of each department to schedule appointments with
                  advisers.

                <p>
                  After conducting some background research, our team designed
                  and developed a more dedicated undergraduate advising site to
                  allow users to schedule advising appointments with any
                  department from one central location.

                  Created an improved and functionable web app for undergraduate
                  students at the University of Washington to explore different
                  majors and schedule advising appointments with ease.

        <br />
        <p>
          The current undergraduate advising website for the University of
          Washington (UW) provides students with a multitude of resources
          pertaining to degree requirements, major planning, academic support,
          and more. The site as a whole includes lots of helpful resources for
          the purpose of answering questions that undergraduate students might
          ask during advising appointments. Given the size of the university,
          this makes sense that these resources would be made available to
          filter out the number of students scheduling advising appointments,
          and to answer generic questions. However, the distinction between
          general undergraduate advising and departmental advising isn't exactly
          clear. <br /><br />
        </p>
        <img
          src="./img/advising/original-site-advising.png"
          alt="page students see when clicking on the 'book appointment' link on the original site"
          id="background-advising"
        />
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          When students select "BOOK AN IN-PERSON OR ONLINE ADVISING
          APPOINTMENT", they are taken to a page containing the content above.
          The number of different links on this page could potentially be
          <b>overwhelming</b> to a user, and it is <b>misleading</b> because it
          is not what a student would expect to encounter when clicking on the
          booking link. A student might expect options to directly book adviser
          appointments, but this is not the case.
          <b
            >There is no central site for students to book advising
            appointments.</b
          ><br /><br />
          When looking to meet with an adviser, they are taken to
          <a href="https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/">this</a> general
          advising website and may be unaware that major-specific questions can
          only be answered by departmental advisers. It takes some digging, but
          you can eventually find a
          <a
            href="http://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/advising-offices-by-program/"
            >list</a
          >
          of all the departments at UW with contact information for the advising
          offices. Even this resource is unfortunately outdated. The department
          link only takes you to information in the Student Guide, rather than
          the official website for appointment booking.

        <h5>Brainstorming</h5>
        <img
          src="./img/advising/brainstorming.PNG"
          alt="brainstorming sticky notes for interactive features"
          id="brainstorming-sketch-advising"
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          For brainstorming, we exercised rapid ideation to acquire a diverse
          list of possible interactive features for the web app. A constraint
          for this project was the need to design and implement at least two
          interactive features. Interactive features change the view of the web
          page in some way based on some sort of dataset. (We planned to use our
          own .JSON data) .
        </p>
        <h5>Personas</h5>
        Below are two user personas (Jenna and Chris) we created in order to
        better envision which interactive features to develop in our web app. We
        explored a student's use for the web app early on in their college
        career, in addition to the web app's usefulness for a student already
        established at the university.

        />
        <br />
        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <img
          src="./img/advising/sketching.PNG"
          alt="sketches of potential layouts"
          id="ideation-sketch-advising"
        />
        <p>
          Each team member began by creating 1-2 hand-drawn, low-fidelity
          sketches of possible layouts for the advising webpage.

          Our first prototype was created solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          We also used mobile-first design principles to make this prototype
          fully responsive (compatible with a wide range of screen sizes).<br /><br />Click

        <br />
        <h5>User Testing</h5>
        <p>
          Each team member asked 2-3 people to provide feedback on both the
          design and usability of our first prototype. Following this, we
          reiterated upon our first prototype by implementing their feedback.
          Below are some comments our users gave us:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              "I don't know how to get to the landing page from the advising
              page."
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              "It would be nice to automatically filter availability by the
              slider instead of clicking a button."
            </p>
          </li>

          Reiterating upon our first prototype using the feedback we received
          from user testing, our final design used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          added React.js and Firebase Hosting for data persistence. Some notable
          differences between our first prototype and final design was the
          navigation bar, which allowed for clearer organization of the website,
          and the overall improvement of our interactive features. We also
          integrated our web app with Firebase Hosting, so users could log in
          and save their data. The data saved upon logging out were the
          different departments each user favorited. <br /><br />Click

          to view our final web app.

          ***Note: The feature I was responsible for implementing was the
          "filtering" function. The "favorites" feature was implemented by
          another team member, and may not be functionable anymore due to the
          expiration of our Firebase Hosting.

        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
        <p>
          This was my first experience designing and developing a web
          application, and I absolutely loved it! User Testing was extremely
          helpful; learning how to take critique and transform the feedback into
          realistic, actionable steps was a rewarding process that contributed
          to the success of this project.
