                <p>
                  Given the theme of the Women in Informatics' Hackathon,
                  "Driven by Difference," we were tasked with identifying a
                  problem by interpreting this theme and developing a solution
                  for it.

                <p>
                  A navigation app prototype, SafePath, that provides users
                  information regarding route and location safety information
                  based on a calculated safety score, while allowing users to
                  stay informed in their communities through alerts and reviews.

                <p>
                  Designed a high-fidelity prototype. Users can select a route
                  based on a Safety Score calculated by SafePath. The purpose of
                  SafePath is to provide a useful and relevant solution to help
                  members of all backgrounds in our community.

        <h5>Background + Research</h5>
        <p>
          In light of the #MeToo movement, the University of Chicago conducted a
          2019 study on street harassment, finding that 71% of women and 28% of
          men experienced street harassment. Women disproportionately experience
          this, as do people of color. Taking this into account, our team
          proposed a navigational app that would allow users to make more
          informed decisions about their travel routes.
        </p>
        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <img
          src="./img/safepath/sketches.PNG"
          alt="hand-drawn sketches of alerts and profile pages"
          id="ideation-sketch-safepath"
        />
        <p>
          Each team member began by creating 1-2 hand-drawn, low-fidelity
          sketches of their assigned features of the prototype. I was tasked
          with the Alerts and Profile tabs.
        </p>
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          After discussing and refining our sketches, we used Figma to
          immediately transform our sketches into high-fidelity wireframes. We
          collaborated on semantically connecting the pages to create a cohesive
          prototype.
        </p>
        <h5>Logo Design</h5>
        <p>
          I took on the task of designing a logo for our app. Drawing
          inspiration from the visual appearance of location pinpoints, and our
          emphasis on safety (S), below is the logo I designed using Adobe
          Illustrator:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./img/safepath/logo.png"
          id="safepath-logo"
          alt="SafePath logo"
        />
        <h5>Final Product</h5>
        <p>
          We successfully created a navigation app prototype in under 12 hours.
          Given more time, we would have liked to better operationalize our
          Safety Score calculations.

        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
        <p>
          Considering the fact that my three other team members and I did not
          know each other prior to the event, I did not expect to be able to
          work as effectively as we did. I learned how to be agile working in a
          team setting by being upfront about personal strengths when delegating
          tasks. I also learned how to produce quality results under time
          constraints.
