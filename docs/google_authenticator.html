                <p>
                  Google Authenticator is a dated application. Aside from key
                  security features that other competitors have incorporated,
                  they also lack brand cohesion and accessibility options.

                <h5>Proposed Solution</h5>
                <p>
                  After conducting article research and competitor analysis, I
                  proposed a redesign of the Google Authenticator application to
                  include accessibility options, modern security features, and
                  better branding aesthetics.

        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
          In 2015, there were 59 million cybersecurity incidents reported
          worldwide, and by 2020, this number rose to 300 million. Released in
          2010, Google Authenticator is a Google application for two-factor
          authentication, commonly used in conjunction with Google accounts, and
          designed to reduce the risk of online breaches. Rather than verifying
          an account during the login process with a text message, Google
          Authenticator generates random codes a user can enter instead as the
          second factor.
        </p>
        <h5>Article Research</h5>
        <p>
          Each team member began by reading 3-4 articles to gain an objective
          understanding of Google Authenticator's affordances.
        </p>
        <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
        <p>
          We compared and contrasted the differences between Google
          Authenticator and other two-factor authenticator applications such as
          LastPass, Authy, and Duo. As part of this analysis, we also looked at
          User Reviews on the iOS app store to learn what types of features
          users liked or disliked about these applications.
        </p>
        <h5>User Personas</h5>
        <p>
          To facilitate our design process, we produced two user personas.
          Person A, a 30-year old active user of Google Authenticator, and
          Person B, a 51-year old first-time user of Google Authenticator. We
          sought to analyze the two broad categories of user types for Google
          Authenticator in order to improve upon the functional aspects of the
          application.
        </p>
        <h5>User Interaction Flow</h5>
        <p>[insert image] This was the UI flow for the original application.</p>
        <p>
          [insert image] This is our redesigned UI flow, created using Adobe
          Illustrator.
        </p>
        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <p>
          Each team member began by creating 1-2 hand-drawn, low-fidelity
          sketches of a redesigned Google Authenticator based off of the
          background research we conducted.
        </p>
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          Following ideation, my team reconvened and discussed the sketches we
          had created. We noted the features we felt were necessary, and agreed
          upon a sketch to create as a UI prototype in Figma.
        </p>
        <h5>Final Design</h5>
        <p>
          Using Figma, we created a clickable prototype of our redesigned
          version of Google Authenticator.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          User personas were critical to understanding how to redesign this
          application. Each challenge presented me with an opportunity to be
          more empathetic in my decision-making as a designer.
