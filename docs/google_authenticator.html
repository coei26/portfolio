                <p>
                  Google Authenticator is a dated application. Aside from key
                  security features that other competitors have incorporated,
                  they also lack brand cohesion and accessibility options.

                <h5>Proposed Solution</h5>
                <p>
                  After conducting article research and competitor analysis, I
                  proposed a redesign of the Google Authenticator application to
                  include accessibility options, modern security features, and
                  better branding aesthetics.

        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
          In 2015, there were 59 million cybersecurity incidents reported
          worldwide, and by 2020, this number rose to 300 million. Released in
          2010, is a Google application for two-factor authentication, commonly
          used in conjunction with Google accounts, and designed to reduce the
          risk of online breaches. Rather than verifying an account during the
          login process with a text message, Google Authenticator generates
          random codes a user can enter instead as the second factor.
        </p>
        <h5>Article Research</h5>
        <p>
          Each team member began by reading 3-4 articles to gain an objective
          understanding of Google Authenticator's <b>affordances</b>.
        </p>
        <h5>Competitor Analysis</h5>
        <p>
          We compared and contrasted the differences between Google
          Authenticator and other two-factor authenticator applications such as
          LastPass, Authy, and Duo. As part of this analysis, we also looked at
          <b>user reviews</b> on the iOS app store to learn what types of
          features users liked or disliked about these applications.
        </p>
        <h5>User Personas</h5>
        <p>
          To facilitate our design process, we produced two user personas.
          Person A, a 30-year old active user of Google Authenticator, and
          Person B, a 51-year old first-time user of Google Authenticator. We
          sought to analyze the two broad categories of user types for Google
          Authenticator in order to better understand our users, reflect upon
          their needs, and improve the functionality of the application.
        </p>
        <h5>User Interaction Flow</h5>

          alt="a user interface flow of the original Google Authenticator design"
          id="google-staging"
        /><br />
        <p>This was the UI flow for the original application.</p>
        <br />

          alt="a user interface flow of our redesigned version of Google Authenticator"
          id="google-staging"
        /><br />
        <p>This is our redesigned UI flow, created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <img
          src="./img/google/low-fidelity-sketch.PNG"
          alt="a user interface flow of our redesigned version of Google Authenticator"
          id="ideation-sketch"
        /><br />
        <p>
          Each team member began by creating 1-2 hand-drawn, <b>low-fidelity</b>
          sketches of a redesigned Google Authenticator based off of the
          background research we conducted.
        </p>
        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          Following ideation, my team reconvened and discussed the sketches we
          had created. We noted the key features to include based off of our
          User Personas and research. Finally, we agreed to iterate upon one of
          our low-fidelity sketches in Figma.
        </p>
        <h5>Final Design</h5>
        <p>
          Using Figma, we created a clickable, <b>high-fidelity</b> prototype of
          our redesigned version of Google Authenticator.

        <h5>Takeaways</h5>
        <p>
          User personas were critical to understanding how to redesign this
          application. The challenges I encountered in this project gave me
          opportunities to be more empathetic in my decision-making as a
          designer.
