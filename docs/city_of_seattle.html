      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This visualization was created from a dataset I transformed from the
        <a
          href="https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5"
          >Seattle Police Department's Crime Data</a
        >, which consists of offenses from the years 2008 to 2020. As a student
        going to school and living in the city of Seattle, I was particularly
        interested in conducting a more granular exploration of the different
        locations where assault crimes were most frequent over the years.

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          Where in Seattle do assault crimes most frequently occur? Whether it
          be a student deciding which routes to walk to get to class, new
          residents looking to buy a home, or even police departments deciding
          on specific patrol routes, knowing where assault crimes have most
          frequently occurred provide valuable information to any given person.
          Creating a visualization that answers this question can reveal
          important insights. For example, as a student at the University of
          Washington, zooming into the University District area will reveal that
          a greater number of assault offenses have occurred along University
          Way NE relative to other surrounding areas of the school. Therefore,
          when walking to class or alone at night, University Way NE may be an
          area to avoid. In this same way, zooming out of the map will show that
          the downtown areas of Seattle (Belltown, International District) have
          greater occurrences of assault crimes. In contrast, it is evident that
          some of the areas on the east side of Seattle such as Broadmoor, Denny
          Blaine and Madrona contain significantly less assault incidents.
          Therefore, these might be neighborhoods potential home buyers might
          consider, and interestingly, these happen to be some of the most
          affluent neighborhoods in the city of Seattle.

        <h2>Dataset Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The type of the transformed dataset is a
          <b>multidimensional table</b>. There are two keys,
          <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em>, which are required to look
          up the value attribute <em>n</em>.
        </p>
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Column</th>
              <th scope="col">Data Type</th>
              <th scope="col">Semantics</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

            <tr>
              <td scope="row">latitude</td>
              <td>
                Position<br /><br />
                This is spatial data that is paired with longitude to
                quantitatively describe a location on the Earth's surface.
              </td>
              <td>
                Key<br /><br />
                This key attribute represents the angular distance of a place
                north or south of the Earth's equator in degrees. In this
                dataset, the latitudes are all within the city of Seattle.

              <td>
                Key<br /><br />
                This key attribute represents the angular distance of a place
                east or west of the meridian at Greenwich, England, expressed in
                degrees. In this dataset, the longitudes are all within the city
                of Seattle.

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td scope="row">n</td>
              <td>
                Attribute<br /><br />
                This is a specific property that is measured, observed, or
                logged. The type of this attribute is ordered quantitative data,
                as each number corresponds to a specific latitude-longitude
                pair.
              </td>
              <td>
                Value<br /><br />
                This value attribute represents the total number of assault
                crimes recorded at each specific latitude-longitude pair from
                2008 to 2020 in the city of Seattle. This number was a new
                attribute derived by filtering the "offense" column in the
                original data for any offenses relating to assault.
              </td>

          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Design Choices</h2>
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Design Choice</th>
              <th scope="col">Rationale</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td scope="row">Using a point map</td>
              <td>
                Due to the nature of the question being about location, I chose
                to visualize the data using a map, given the latitudinal and
                longitudinal coordinates of the data. Since I was interested in
                the city of Seattle in particular, it was most effective to use
                points to denote locations rather than filled regions of space.
                Additionally, using points satisfied the granularity I was
                interested in exploring, as it is easy to locate where the
                greatest number of assault offenses occur down to a very
                specific location on a street.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td scope="row">Including a legend</td>
              <td>
                Including a legend makes it very clear to the viewer that each
                point in the map is scaled by size, and that each point
                represents the total number of assault offenses that have
                occurred at the location from 2008 to 2020. While the dot sizes
                might not seem most ideal, they do effectively communicate the
                range in number of assault offenses, with the maximum number of
                assault offenses at one location being 1,252.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td scope="row">Excluding (0,0) latitude-longitude values</td>
              <td>
                While filtering the data, I noticed that there were a number of
                assault offenses that had the value 0 for both latitude and
                longitude. Since the purpose of this visualization was to
                display different locations in Seattle where assault crimes
                occurred, including these points would not only be irrelevant to
                the question, but would also be inaccurate, as it is clear the
                location of these particular assault offenses were not available
                or documented.

              <td>
                I performed four main transformations to the original dataset.
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    I grouped (aggregated) the data by the columns latitude and
                    longitude.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I filtered to exclude the latitude and longitude columns
                    containing the value 0.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I filtered the offense column to only include rows
                    containing the word "Assault".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I summed up the number of assault offenses for each
                    latitude-longitude pair and created a new column, n to
                    represent the numbers.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                By transforming the original dataset, I was left with a smaller
                subset of data that consisted wholly of the relevant values used
                in my visualization. Additionally, by transforming the data, I
                was able to use a new column of data that allowed me to answer a
                more specific question and ultimately created a more interesting
                visualization.

            <tr>
              <td scope="row">Visually encoding by size</td>
              <td>
                To answer my question of locations where assault crimes most
                frequently occurred, I included the visual encoding of size. The
                greater the size, the greater the number of assault offenses
                that occurred at the location. As a result, encoding by size was
                effective in denoting locations where assault crimes more
                frequently occurred.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td scope="row">Using a grayscale color scheme</td>
              <td>
                While I could have encoded different colors for locations where
                the greatest numbers of assault offenses occurred, the size of
                the data made this unnecessary. Adding an encoding for color
                could also convolute the visualization, as size is already
                encoded. The black points nicely contrast the gray map
                background, making the map accessible to those with vision
                impairments, and using a grayscale makes this visualization
                accessible to those who may be colorblind.
